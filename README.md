# Project Name

This project utilizes Helm charts to deploy an init container that utilizes Flyway to set up a PostgreSQL database. Additionally, it includes a container that polls from Kafka to store CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) records in the PostgreSQL database on Kubernetes.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Helm
- Kubernetes cluster
- Kafka
- PostgreSQL

## Installation

To deploy the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git
  ```

2. Change into the project directory:

  ```shell
  cd helm-webapp-cve-consumer
  ```

3. Install the Helm chart:

  ```shell
  helm install my-release ./helm-chart
  ```

4. Wait for the deployment to complete:

  ```shell
  kubectl get pods
  ```

## Configuration

The Helm chart can be customized by modifying the values in the `values.yaml` file. Update the necessary configurations such as Kafka and PostgreSQL connection details according to your environment.

## Usage

Once the deployment is successful, the application will start polling from Kafka and storing CVE records in the PostgreSQL database. You can monitor the logs of the application to ensure everything is running smoothly.
